:::tldr
This section will explain how to build a Typewriter :term[extension] in Kotlin: project setup with the module plugin, the :term[entry] families, :term[interactions], querying, triggering and dependency injection.
:::

## What will live here

- **Extensions**: what an extension is and what it can add to the engine.
- **Getting started**: a Gradle project with the module plugin, building the JAR and loading it with :cmd[/tw reload].
- **Entries**: trigger, static, manifest and cinematic entries (the code name for :term[scene] cues), with a guide for picking the right base type.
- **Engine APIs**: interactions, querying, triggering and dependency injection.

## Before you begin

- JDK :var[java] or newer and an IDE with Kotlin support.
- Working knowledge of Gradle and the Paper API.
- Typewriter :var[latest] on a Paper :var[paper] test server.

Pages in this section use the same [writing syntax](../docs/01-syntax.md) as the user documentation.
