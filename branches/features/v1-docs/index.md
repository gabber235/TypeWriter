<BuildItem
    title="Dialogue"

NPCs talk in chat, players answer with options, and each answer can lead somewhere else.

<BuildItem

Objectives count kills, distance and blocks, show progress in the sidebar, and hand over to the next objective when done.

Camera moves, titles, particles and spoken lines on one timeline, timed to the frame.

Define an NPC once, then place instances that patrol a road network, look at players and react when clicked.

<Steps cta={{ label: 'Start with the install guide', href: `${BASE_PATH}docs/` }}>
<Step
    number={1}
    title="Connect your server to a realm"
    mockup={{
      src: panelConnect,
      alt: 'Wireframe mockup of the panel’s Services page with the Connect a Service dialog open: a ten-cell token field with seven cells filled, and a Connect button.',
    }}
  >

Install the plugin next to PacketEvents and start the server. The console prints a ten-character registration token; paste it into the panel under **Services → Connect a Service** and the server joins your :term[realm].

</Step>
<Step
    number={2}
    title="Build pages in the panel"
    mockup={{
      src: panelLibrary,
      alt: 'Wireframe mockup of the Library: a grid of eight coloured book covers, the first one selected, with its details in the inspector.',
    }}
  >

Create a :term[book] in the Library, add :term[pages], and place entries on them. Sequence pages hold dialogue and actions, scene pages hold timed cues, manifest pages hold audiences that stay active while a condition is true.

</Step>
<Step number={3} title="Play it on your server">

Players talk to your NPCs in chat, pick options, complete objectives and watch scenes on the server connected to the realm. Nothing to install on the client.

1. [9%, 27%] **Pages by chapter** — every page in the book, grouped into chapters. The search box above filters them.
2. [29%, 34%] **Event element** — something the player did. Its arrows are :term[triggers]: when this finishes, the next element runs.
3. [82%, 41%] **Inspector** — the fields of the selected element, rendered from the extension's definition.
4. [22%, 96%] **Shortcuts** — the panel is keyboard first. :kbd[Shift+M] moves, :kbd[Shift+R] resizes, :kbd[Ctrl+H] to :kbd[Ctrl+L] switch panes, :kbd[Esc] returns to Normal mode.

Press :kbd[S] or :kbd[/] and search the whole realm with `key:value` selectors. Results group into entries, definitions, pages, books and tags.

Every player gets their own version of your story. One page can greet a stranger, thank the person who brought the iron and turn away someone who already claimed the reward. Typewriter stores :term[facts] per player; :term[criteria] read them before an entry runs and :term[modifiers] change them afterwards.

An :term[extension] is a JAR of Kotlin classes marked `@Entry`. The panel reads the annotation for the name, description, colour and icon, turns the constructor parameters into inspector fields, and the server runs the body. The ten extensions that ship with Typewriter, about five hundred entries, are written exactly like this one.

:::details[Do I need to know how to code?]{name=faq}
No. Everything on this page is built in the panel by placing entries and connecting them. Kotlin only comes in when you write your own extension because the shipped entries do not cover a case.
:::

:::details[Is 1.0 ready to use?]{name=faq}
Not yet. Typewriter 1.0 is in active development: the new panel, the realm service and these docs are being built in the open. Expect gaps, and ask on the [Discord](:var[discord]) for the current state before moving a live server to it.
:::

:::details[Do I host the panel?]{name=faq}
No. The 1.0 panel is a hosted web app. You sign in, create an organization and a realm, and connect servers to it with a registration token. The plugin is the only thing you run.
:::

:::details[Is it open source?]{name=faq}
It is source-available. The code is on [GitHub](:var[github]) under the Typewriter Software License, which allows use and contribution but not redistribution or modification outside the project.

Install the plugin, connect a realm and build your first page. The docs start where this page ends.
