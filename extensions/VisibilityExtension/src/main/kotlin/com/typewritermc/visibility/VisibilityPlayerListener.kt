/**
 * Keeps the per player state of the visibility system in step with connections.
 *
 * The engine disposes effectors a tick after a player leaves the selection, which for a disconnect
 * is a tick after the player is already gone. Anything an effector keys by the viewer (packet hooks,
 * client side teams) would then survive into the viewer's next session and apply with no rule behind
 * it, so it is dropped here the moment the connection ends. Hides need no such care: the engine's
 * [com.typewritermc.engine.paper.utils.PlayerHides] forgets a disconnected player itself.
