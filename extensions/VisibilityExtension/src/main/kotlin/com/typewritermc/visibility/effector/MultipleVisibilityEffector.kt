/**
 * Composes multiple sub effectors into a single effect for a pair.
 *
 * Sub effectors are initialized in order and disposed in reverse order, effectors providing a
 * visible replacement go first so sibling overlays follow the visible entity. When one fails to
 * initialize, every sub effector that was reached is disposed, including the one that threw, and the
 * failure is rethrown so the engine retracts the whole effect. Ticks are forwarded to the sub
 * effectors that are themselves [TickableVisibilityEffector]s.
