/**
 * The `Player Command Action` is an action that runs a command as if the player entered it.
 * This action provides you with the ability to execute commands on behalf of the player in response to specific events.
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 *
 * This action can be useful in a variety of situations.
 * You can use it to provide players with a custom command that triggers a specific action,
 * such as teleporting the player to a specific location or giving them an item.
 * You can also use it to automate repetitive tasks,
 * such as sending a message to the player when they complete a quest or achievement.
 * The possibilities are endless!
