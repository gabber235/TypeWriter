/**
 * The `Player Join Event` event is called when a player joins the server.
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 *
 * This could be used with [facts](https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/creating-stories/facts) to give a new player a welcome message, or welcome back new players.
 * You can also use it to give new players a starting item, or to give them a starting amount of money with the Vault adapter.
