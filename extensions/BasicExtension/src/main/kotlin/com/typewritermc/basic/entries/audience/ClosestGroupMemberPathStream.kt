/**
 * The `Closest Group Member Path Stream` entry is a path stream that shows the path to the closest group member.
 * The 'Closest Group Member' is determined by the group member that is closest to the player geographically,
 * **Not based on the path distance.**
 *
 * When the group is not set, the path stream will not display anything.
 * Players must be in the same world for the path stream to consider them.
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 * This could be used to show a path to the closest group member in a group of players.
 * When a player is lost, they can follow the path to the closest group member.
