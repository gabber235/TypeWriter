/**
 * The `Trigger Sequence Cinematic` entry that runs a sequence of triggers. It is very powerful but also very dangerous.
 *
 * :::caution
 * Be aware of which triggers are running. If you run a trigger that is viewable by everyone, it will be visible to everyone.
 * Also, **never trigger dialogues**, they should not be triggered from a cinematic.
 * If you want to trigger a dialogue after the cinematic, connect it to the [CinematicEntry](../action/cinematic.mdx)
 * :::
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 * When you want to use any triggerable entry. Like giving an item to the player at a specific frame.
