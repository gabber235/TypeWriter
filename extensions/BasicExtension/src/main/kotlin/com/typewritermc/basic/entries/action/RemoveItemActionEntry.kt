/**
 * The `Remove Item Action` is an action that removes an item from the player's inventory.
 * This action provides you with the ability to remove items from the player's inventory in response to specific events.
 * <Admonition type="caution">
 *     This action will try to remove "as much as possible" but does not verify if the player has enough items in their inventory.
 *     If you want to guarantee that the player has enough items in their inventory, add an
 *     <Link to='../fact/inventory_item_count_fact'>Inventory Item Count Fact</Link> to the criteria.
 * </Admonition>
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 *
 * This can be used when `giving` an NPC an item, and you want to remove the item from the player's inventory.
 * Or when you want to remove a key from the player's inventory after they use it to unlock a door.
