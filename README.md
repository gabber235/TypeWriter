Typewriter is a plugin for **Paper** Minecraft servers that allows for custom player interactions such as Quests,
NPC chat, Create branching story with ease, Creating Cinematic with camera paths, creating NPC's with intelligent behaviour, and more. 
It is easily configurable using the web panel specifically designed for this plugin.

The power of Typewriter comes from the fact that it is extensible using adapters. 
Adapters are self-contained modular components that allow you to create custom content for Typewriter.
Some adapters are already made by the developers of Typewriter, but anyone can create their own custom adapters.

To get started with Typewriter, see the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
