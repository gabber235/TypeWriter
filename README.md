## For Administrators

Typewriter makes it simple for server admins to create and manage custom content. Through the web panel, you can easily configure complex interactions, NPCs, and quests, even without prior coding knowledge. If your server has specific requirements, the extension system allows for easy customization and the addition of new features.

## For Developers

Typewriter is built to be highly extensible. The **extensions** system lets developers build modular, reusable components that seamlessly integrate with the plugin. To learn more about creating extensions, or any other development related questions, visit the [Development Documentation](https://docs.typewritermc.com/develop).
