# Is there any way to interact with Citizen NPC only by right-click?
</user>
<user>
Hi! Due to some plugins having not been updated, my server is still staying on 1.20.1 (which means 0.4.2 Typewriter)

The problem is, I have been using a different quest plugin which requires the left-click for accepting quests from an npc, yet this seems to conflict with Typewriter's either left or right click interaction.

Is there any way to solve this? Like only specifying right-click to Typewriter npc interaction. (Sorry I don't know if the latest version have changed this)
