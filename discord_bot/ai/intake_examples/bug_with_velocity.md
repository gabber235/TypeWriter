# Bug with velocity
</user>
<user>
Helloo, I tried the new beta 129 version of typewriter on 1.21 with the extensions and it seems to have some issues with velocity when I interact with an NPC an error appears in the console and the Interaction doesn't work also.

It worked on typewriter v0.5.1 but unfortunately not on v0.6.0

This is the error:
```
Error sending packet clientbound/minecraft:system_chat (skippable? true)
io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: Failed to encode packet 'clientbound/minecraft:system_chat'
        at net.minecraft.network.codec.IdDispatchCodec.encode(IdDispatchCodec.java:53) ~[paper-1.21.1.jar:1.21.1-122-4430e96]
...

Expected behavior:
I'm trying to interact with an NPC with the Entity adapter, it should work like in the docs
https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/creating-stories/entity-adapter

Reproduction steps:
1. Use a proxy for example velocity
2. Follow the docs https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/creating-stories/entity-adapter/interacting
3. Interact with the NPC
(Might also crash minecraft)

For minecraft crash:
1. Use the citizens adapter
2. Add Add On NPC Interact
3. Link with new spoken & link the speaker to the citizens NPC
4. Interact with the NPC

Typewriter Version: v0.6.0 beta 129
