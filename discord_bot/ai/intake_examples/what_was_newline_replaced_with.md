All the line breaks don't work, but I can't find any new line breaks in the wiki. My NPC name needs a line feed

To make support staff help you faster, provide the following information:
 - **What exactly are you trying to achieve?** Why do you need the line breaks for the NPC name?
 - **What have you already tried?** Have you looked through any documentation or tried using different entries?

Providing the above information is **mandatory** for the ticket to be answered and look by the support team.

I want to have a template below the npc by default. Like "black smith" or "captain". 

Originally I made it with the `<newline>` in the definition and having it be two lines. But that is not possible in the latest beta anymore.

I don't know how to fix it myself or even what to try...
