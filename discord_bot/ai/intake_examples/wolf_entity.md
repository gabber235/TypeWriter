<user>
I tried to find wolf definition, but couldn't find it. Did I miss it, or  hasn't been added yet?

To help support staff assist you effectively, please provide the following information:

- **Did you check?** Has the wolf entity not already been added to the entity extension?
- **Does this have priority?** Should we add the addition of this entity to our priority list?

Providing the above information is **mandatory** for the ticket to be answered and looked at by the support team.
