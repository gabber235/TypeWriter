# Add the dialogue function using Actionbar
</user>
<user>
Can we add Actionbar-based dialogue and selection functions? Due to the limited space of Chat, in some cases, the option function occupies part of the space, so it is difficult to fully display the content expressed.

Currently, things like option dialogue can only be displayed in the chat. But I want to display it in the action bar.
Like have the conversation and option displayed in the action bar.

I think it is easier to read and understand the conversation and options in the action bar rather than in the chat.
It is more central and can look cooler.
