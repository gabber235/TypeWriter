Let's work together to resolve this issue.

- **Extensions correctly installed?** Did you install the extensions correctly? It should show in the console logs that the extensions where correctly loaded.
- **Can you view the web panel?** Are you able to connect to the web panel and create a page?

Providing the above information is **mandatory** for the ticket to be answered and look by the support team.
