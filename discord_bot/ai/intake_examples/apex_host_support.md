Hello it's been a while that I have created this support: https://discord.com/channels/1054708062520360960/1208744946002165792 it was around February right? then my last reponse was April 20, 2024;

Now as I can see here it says in Beta and In Production, does it mean that it now support ApexHosting and this plugin will work?

I have no idea what that means, I'm not a developer, I just want to use it

Typewriter needs 2 fresh network ports to work.
Some hosting providers allow you to open additional ports, but others do not.

Network ports are essentially identifiers for processes in Typewriter.

Are you able to open 2 additional ports on Apex Hosting?

<user>
No, I can't open any more ports
