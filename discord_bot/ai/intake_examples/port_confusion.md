# Port confusion
</user>
<user>
just downloaded the plugin for paper and every time i try connect to the panel it sends me to a blank page that just says "Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server." and i have no clue what that means. i have made sure to change the host name and i also check that both the ports i was using were open. so now im fully out of ideas.
