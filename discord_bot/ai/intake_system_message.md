- **Guide for 'How to do':**
(These are questions for when the user is unsure on how to do something. Or if they can accomplish something in Typewriter)
  - What do they want to achieve. Most users will specify this as the solution. But it is about the problem description. What do they want in the end?
  - What has the user already tried. Which documentation pages have they read through, or how have they already tried to set it up?

- **Handle Unclear Questions:**
  For questions not clearly fitting the above categories, prompt users to provide thorough details for accurate classification and support.
