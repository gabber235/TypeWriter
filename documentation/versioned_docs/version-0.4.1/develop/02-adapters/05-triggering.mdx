# Triggering Entries

There are easy ways to trigger all the next entries in a `TriggerEntry`.
The most important is that you have a `player` to trigger the entries on.

:::info
Typewriter takes care of only triggering the entries that should be triggered.
If criteria are not met, the entries are not triggered.
:::

If you have a single `TriggerEntry`:
```kotlin
val triggerEntry: TriggerEntry = ...
val player: Player = ...
triggerEntry triggerAllFor player
```

If you have list of `TriggerEntry`:
```kotlin
val triggerEntries: List<TriggerEntry> = ...
val player: Player = ...
triggerEntries triggerAllFor player
```

If you have a list of id's of `TriggerEntry`:
```kotlin
val triggerEntryIds: List<String> = ...
val player: Player = ...
triggerEntryIds triggerEntriesFor player
```

Sometimes you don't want to trigger the entries when the player is in a dialogue. 
For example, when the player is in a dialogue with a NPC, you don't want to trigger the first entry of the NPC again.
You expect when the player clicks on the NPC again, the next dialogue is triggered.
To facilitate this, you can use the `startDialogueWithOrNextDialogue` function.

```kotlin
val triggerEntries: List<TriggerEntry> = ...
val player: Player = ...
triggerEntries startDialogueWithOrNextDialogue player
```

Or if you want to trigger something completely different when the player is in a dialogue:
```kotlin
val triggerEntries: List<TriggerEntry> = ...
val player: Player = ...
val customTrigger: EventTrigger = ...
triggerEntries.startDialogueWithOrTrigger(player, customTrigger)
```


## Custom triggers
Typewriter triggers based on the `EventTrigger` interface.
So all the entries that are triggered are wrapped in a `EntryTrigger`.

There are some triggers that are defined in Typewriter. 
The two are `SystemTrigger` and `CinematicStartTrigger`.

### SystemTrigger

`SystemTrigger`'s can be used to indicate to either the `DialogueSequence` or the `CinematicSequence` that something needs to happen.

- `SystemTrigger.DIALOGUE_NEXT` indicates that the next dialogue should be triggered.
- `SystemTrigger.DIALOGUE_END` indicates that the dialogue should end.
- `SystemTrigger.CINEMATIC_END` indicates that the cinematic should end.

### CinematicStartTrigger

`CinematicStartTrigger`'s can be used to indicate to the `CinematicSequence` that a cinematic should start.

It has several properties that can be set:
- `pageId: String` is the id of the cinematic page that should be shown. This is required.
- `triggers: List<String>` is a list of trigger id's that should be triggered when the cinematic is finished. This is optional.
- `override: Boolean` indicates if the cinematic should override the current cinematic. This is optional and defaults to `false`.
- `simulate: Boolean` is used to run a cinematic for recording purposes. When this is enable it disables some entries from running. This is optional and defaults to `false`.
- `ignoreEntries: List<String>` is a list of entry id's that should not be triggered. This is optional.
- `minEndTime: Optional<Int>` is the minimum amount of frames the cinematic should run. If the cinematic is shorter than this, it will be extended. This is optional.
