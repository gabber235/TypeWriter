# CinematicEntry

The `CinematicEntry` does not have any decentends, but is very customizable. When a entry is needed in a cinematic page, it needs to inherid this.

`CinematicEntry` works by having at least 1 list of `Segment`'s. Segments are the parts of the cinematic and may have sub-properties defined. A segment needs to have at least a `startFrame` and `endFrame` which are the integers of the frames.

Frames are the ticks in a second. So there are 20 frames in a second. A cinematic takes as long as the latest `endFrame` of a segment from all it's entries.

Segments are defined in the entry using the `@Segments` annotation. And it needs to be a list of `Segment`'s.


:::info
A `CinematicEntry` can have multiple different segment tracks. 
For example, a cinematic entry may have a `TextSegment` and a `SoundSegment`. 

Though this is supported in the plugin, it is not yet implemented in the cinematic editor.

As entries are not allowed to have any state, we create a `CinematicAction` everytime a entry is used in a cinematic for a player.

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_cinematic", "An example cinematic entry.", Colors.CYAN, Icons.TERMINAL)
class ExampleCinematicEntry(
    override val id: String,
    override val name: String,
    override val criteria: List<Criteria>,
    @Segments(Colors.CYAN, Icons.TERMINAL)
    override val segments: List<ExampleSegment>,
): CinematicEntry {
    override fun create(player: Player): CinematicAction {
        return ExampleCinematicAction(player, this)
    }
}
```

Segments sometimes need a minimum or maximum duration. This can be done using the `@InnerMin` and `@InnerMax` annotations. 

```kotlin
@Segments(Colors.CYAN, Icons.TERMINAL)
@InnerMin(Min(10))
@InnerMax(Max(20))
override val segments: List<ExampleSegment>,
```

This will make sure that the segment will be at least 10 frames long and at most 20 frames long.

### ExampleSegment
```kotlin
data class ExampleSegment(
    override val startFrame: Int,
    override val endFrame: Int,
): Segment
```

### ExampleCinematicAction

The `CinematicAction` is the action that is created when a cinematic is started. It is used to keep track of the current frame and to execute the segments.
There are a few different lifecycle methods that can be used.

- `setup()` is called when the cinematic is created. This is the place to initialize any variables, spawn entities, etc.
- `tick(frame: Int)` is called every frame. This is the place to execute the segments. It is even executed when no segments are active.
- `teardown()` is called when the cinematic is finished. This is the place to remove any entities, etc.
- `canFinish(frame: Int)` the only method that needs to be implemented. It is used by the `CinematicSequence` to determine if the cinematic is finished.

If you need all the customization, you can can implement the `CinematicAction` directly:

```kotlin
class ExampleCinematicAction(
    override val player: Player,
    override val entry: ExampleCinematicEntry,
): CinematicAction {
    override fun setup() {
        // Initialize variables, spawn entities, etc.
    }

    override fun tick(frame: Int) {
        val segment = entry.segments activeSegmentAt frame
        // Can be null if no segment is active

        // Execute segments
    }

    override fun teardown() {
        // Remove entities, etc.
    }

    override fun canFinish(frame: Int): Boolean = entry.segments canFinishAt frame
}
```

### SimpleCinematicAction
Sometimes you don't need all the customization and flexiblity. If you only care about 1 segment track, and only need to do something when a segment starts or ends, you can use the `SimpleCinematicAction`.

```kotlin
class ExampleCinematicAction(
    override val player: Player,
    override val entry: ExampleCinematicEntry,
): SimpleCinematicAction<ExampleSegment>() {
    override val segments: List<ExampleSegment> = entry.segments

    override suspend fun startSegment(segment: ExampleSegment) {
        // Called when a segment starts
    }

    override suspend fun endSegment(segment: ExampleSegment) {
        // Called when a segment ends
    }
}
```
