# SpeakerEntry

The `SpeakerEntry` is a specialized interface extending the `EntityEntry`.
It is designed to enhance dialogues in the game by associating non-player characters (NPCs) with specific names and sounds.
This feature is pivotal for creating more immersive and interactive storytelling experiences in Minecraft.

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_speaker", "An example speaker entry.", Colors.BLUE, Icons.PERSON_TALKING)
class ExampleSpeakerEntry(
    override val id: String = "",
    override val name: String = "",
    override val displayName: String = "",
    override val sound: Sound = Sound.EMPTY,
) : SpeakerEntry
```

This speaker can be used by users in various dialogues and interactions within the game.
Normally, you never need to access the `SpeakerEntry` directly, as it is automatically handled by the `DialogueSequence`.
If you ever do need to access the `SpeakerEntry`, you can do so:

```kotlin
val id = // ID of the speaker
val entry = Query.findById<ExampleSpeakerEntry>(id)
val name = entry.displayName
val sound = entry.sound
```
