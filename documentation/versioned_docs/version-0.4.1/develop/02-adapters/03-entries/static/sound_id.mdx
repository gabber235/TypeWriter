# SoundIdEntry

The `SoundIdEntry` is an interface derived from `StaticEntry`, specifically designed for managing custom sounds within the TypeWriter Spigot plugin.
If a server is using a custom resource pack, the `SoundIdEntry` can be used to add a reference to a custom sound within the resource pack. 

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_sound", "An example sound entry.", Colors.GREEN, Icons.VOLUME_HIGH)
class ExampleSoundIdEntry(
    override val id: String,
    override val name: String,
    override val soundId: String,
) : SoundIdEntry
```

Normally a `SoundIdEntry` handled by the interface when an entry needs a sound.
If you ever would need to access the sound ID directly, it can be done like this:

```kotlin
val id = // ID of the custom sound
val entry = Query.findById<ExampleSoundIdEntry>(id)
val customSound = entry.soundId
```
