# ArtifactEntry

The `ArtifactEntry` is a specialized interface derived from `AssetEntry`.
Its primary purpose is to handle artifacts, which are assets generated by the plugins/adapters itself.
Unlike standard assets, artifacts are usually dynamic and created during runtime.
This makes them particularly useful for storing data that changes based on player interactions or game events.

An essential feature of `ArtifactEntry` is its unique `artifactId`.
This identifier must remain constant once assigned and is used to reference the artifact within the plugin.

## Usage 

Here's a generic example of creating and using an `ArtifactEntry`:

### Defining an ArtifactEntry

```kotlin
@Entry("example_artifact", "An example artifact entry.", Colors.BLUE, Icons.ARROW)
class ExampleArtifactEntry(
    override val id: String = "",
    override val name: String = "",
    override val artifactId: String = "",
) : ArtifactEntry
```

### Accessing the Artifact's Content
```kotlin
import org.koin.java.KoinJavaComponent.get

val assetManager = get<AssetManager>(AssetManager::class.java)

val id = // ID of the entry
val entry = Query.findById<ExampleArtifactEntry>(id)
val content: String = assetManager.fetchAsset(entry)
```

In this example, `ExampleArtifactEntry` is defined as an artifact with a unique identifier. The `assetManager.fetchAsset` method is then used to retrieve the content of the artifact, based on its `artifactId`.
