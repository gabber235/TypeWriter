# SoundSourceEntry

The `SoundSourceEntry` class is used to have a sound play at a specific entity in the world. This can be a moving target like an NPC. The sound source can be used in an entry with a `Sound` parameter. 

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_sound_source", "An example sound source entry.", Colors.GREEN, Icons.VOLUME_HIGH)
class ExampleSoundSourceEntry(
    override val id: String,
    override val name: String,
) : SoundSourceEntry {
    fun getEmitter(): net.kyori.adventure.sound.Sound.Emitter {
        // Return the emitter that should be used for the sound.
        // A bukkit entity can be used here.
    }
}
```

This can be combined with other entry types like `Speaker`. For example, an NPC that speaks can also be a sound emitter.
