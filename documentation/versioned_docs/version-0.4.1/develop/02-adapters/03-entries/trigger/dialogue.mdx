# DialogueEntry

The `DialogueEntry` is used to define a type of dialogue. When a `DialogueEntry` is triggered it's associated `DialogueMessenger` will be used to display the dialogue to the player.
Multiple `DialogueMessenger`'s can be associated with a single `DialogueEntry` and the `DialogueMessenger` that is used is determined by the `DialogueMessenger`'s `MessengerFilter`.

:::info
There can always be at most one `DialogueEntry` active for a player. 
This is automatically handled by Typewriter.

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_dialogue", "An example dialogue entry.", Colors.BLUE, Icons.MESSAGE)
class ExampleDialogueEntry(
) : SoundIdEntr    override val id: String = "",
    override val name: String = "",
    override val criteria: List<Criteria> = emptyList(),
    override val modifiers: List<Modifier> = emptyList(),
    override val triggers: List<String> = emptyList(),
    override val speaker: String = "",
    @MultiLine
    @Placeholder
    @Colored
    @Help("The text to display to the player.")
    val text: String = "",
): DialogueEntry
```

To define the messenger that will be used to display the dialogue to the player, you must create a class that implements the `DialogueMessenger` interface.
```kotlin
@Messenger(ExampleDialogueEntry::class)
class UniversalMessageDialogueDialogueMessenger(player: Player, entry: ExampleDialogueEntry) :
    DialogueMessenger<ExampleDialogueEntry>(player, entry) {

    companion object : MessengerFilter {
        override fun filter(player: Player, entry: DialogueEntry): Boolean = true
    }

    // Called every game tick (20 times per second).
    // The cycle is a parameter that is incremented every tick, starting at 0.
    override fun tick(cycle: Int) {
        super.tick(cycle)
        if (cycle == 0) {
            player.sendMessage("${entry.speakerDisplayName}: ${entry.text}".parsePlaceholders(player).asMini())
            state = MessengerState.FINISHED
        }
    }
}
```

The `DialogueMessenger` has a `MessengerFilter` that is used to determine if the messenger should be used to display the dialogue to the player. When having multiple `MessageFilter`'s make sure that they are deterministic. So if you have some condition, such as if they are bedrock players. One message check that the player is a bedrock player and the other filter check that they are not.

The `state` of the messenger determines what happens to the messenger. 
- `MessengerState.FINISHED` - The dialogue is finished and the next dialogue in the chain will be triggered.
- `MessengerState.CANCELLED` - The dialogue is cancelled and dialogue chain is stopped, even if there are more dialogues in the chain.
- `MessengerState.RUNNING` - The dialogue is still running and will continue to run until the state is changed.

The state object can be changed inside the `tick` method or from outside. It can even be changed from the plugin itself. For example when the user runs a command the dialogue will be cancelled.

There are some additional lifecycle methods that can be overridden.
- `init` - Called when the messenger is initialized. Will be called before the first `tick` call.
- `dispose` - Called when the messenger is disposed. By default this will unregister any listeners that were registered by the messenger.
- `end` - Normally this does not need to be overwritten. Only if you do not want to resend the chat history for some reason.
