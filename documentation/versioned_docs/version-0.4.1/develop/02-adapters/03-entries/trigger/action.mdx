# ActionEntry

The `ActionEntry` defines an action to take. When it is triggered, it will run it's `execute` method.
After which it will trigger all the next entries in the chain.

## Usage

```kotlin
@Entry("example_action", "An example action entry.", Colors.RED, Icons.PERSON_RUNNING)
class ExampleActionEntry(
    override val id: String = "",
    override val name: String = "",
    override val criteria: List<Criteria>,
    override val modifiers: List<Modifier>,
    override val triggers: List<String> = emptyList(),
): ActionEntry {
    override fun execute(player: Player) {
        // Do something
        super.execute(player) // This will apply all the modifiers.
    }
}
```

Typewriter will automatically trigger the next entries in the chain after the `execute` method is called.
If you want to call the next entries in the chain manually, you can should the `CustomTriggeringActionEntry`.
