# Adapters

Adapters are additions that can be added to Typewriter to add more functionality and entries. Most are used as a way to interface with other plugins. Adapters are not required to use Typewriter, but they can be useful.

:::info
You are most likely going to need the [Basic Adapter](../adapters/BasicAdapter). It contains essential building blocks for using Typewriter.
