# What is Typewriter?

Typewriter is a plugin that allows you to create and manage player interactions on your server. It allows you to create
quests, NPC dialogues, and more. It also allows you to manage your server's existing player interactions.

In this wiki there are several pages that will help you get started with Typewriter. The first page is
the [Installation Guide](02-installation-guide.md). This page will help you install Typewriter and the basic adapter. Then you
can follow the [First Interaction](03-first-interaction.mdx) guide to create your first interaction.
