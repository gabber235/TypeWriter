# Player Death Event 

The `Player Death Event` is fired when any player dies. This event allows you to select the cause of death if you wish. If you want to detect when another player kills a player, use the [`Player Kill Player Event`](on_player_kill_player).

## How could this be used?

You can create custom death messages for certain types of deaths, such as falling, drowning, or being killed by another player.


## Fields
