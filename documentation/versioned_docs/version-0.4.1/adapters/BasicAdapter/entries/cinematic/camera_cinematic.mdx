# Camera Cinematic 

The `Camera Cinematic` entry is used to create a cinematic camera path.

:::tip
When starting a camera, Minecraft needs `10` frames to load camera's.
It is suggested to use a [Blinding Cinematic Entry](./blinding_cinematic) and wait for `10`-`20` frames.
Before the first segment to get the smoothest cinematic.
:::

## How could this be used?
When you want to direct the player's attention to a specific object/location.
Or when you want to show off a build.
