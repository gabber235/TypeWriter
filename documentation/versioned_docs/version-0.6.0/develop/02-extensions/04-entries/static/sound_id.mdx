# SoundIdEntry

The `SoundIdEntry` is an interface derived from `StaticEntry`, specifically designed for managing custom sounds within the TypeWriter Spigot plugin.
If a server is using a custom resource pack, the `SoundIdEntry` can be used to add a reference to a custom sound within the resource pack. 

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="sound_id_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

A `SoundIdEntry` handled by the interface when an entry needs a sound.
