# SpeakerEntry

The `SpeakerEntry` is a specialized interface extending the `EntityEntry`.
It is designed to enhance dialogues in the game by associating non-player characters (NPCs) with specific names and sounds.
This feature is pivotal for creating more immersive and interactive storytelling experiences in Minecraft.

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="speaker_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

This speaker can be used by users in various dialogues and interactions within the game.
You almost never need to access the `SpeakerEntry` directly, as it is automatically handled by the `DialogueSequence`.
