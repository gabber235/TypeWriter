# SoundSourceEntry

The `SoundSourceEntry` class is used to have a sound play at a specific entity in the world. This can be a moving target like an NPC. The sound source can be used in an entry with a `Sound` parameter. 

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="sound_source_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

This can be combined with other entry types like `Speaker`. For example, an NPC that speaks can also be a sound emitter.
