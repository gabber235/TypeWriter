# Initializers

Sometimes your extension needs to do some initialization before it can be used.
For example, you might need to add a hook to a plugin to make it work with your extension.

## Declaring an Initializer
To declare an initializer, you need to create a **object** that implements the `Initializable` interface.
And add the `@Initializer` annotation to the class.

<CodeSnippet tag="initializer" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

:::danger Ensure Cleanup
The `shutdown` method is called when the extension is unloaded.
You should make sure that no resources are leaked when the extension is unloaded.
:::

Typewriter will automatically register and call the control flow methods when the extension is loaded and unloaded.
