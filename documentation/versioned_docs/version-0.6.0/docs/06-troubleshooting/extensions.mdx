# Extensions Troubleshooting

Experiencing issues with your Typewriter Extensions? This guide provides step-by-step instructions to ensure your extensions are set up correctly and functioning optimally with the Typewriter plugin.

## Correct Extension Placement

It's important to note that extensions for the Typewriter plugin are not standard Paper plugins. They are special JAR files exclusively for Typewriter, and thus need to be stored separately. To ensure proper functioning:

1. Navigate to the plugin directory: `/plugins/Typewriter/extensions`.
2. If an "extensions" folder does not exist, create one to store your new extensions.
3. Place your extension files inside this "extensions" folder.

This dedicated folder ensures that Typewriter can correctly read and use these extensions without confusing them with regular Paper plugins.

## Extension and Plugin Version Compatibility

For the Typewriter plugin and its extensions to work harmoniously, they must be on the same version. This is crucial for both updating and downgrading:

1. When updating the `typewriter.jar` file, simultaneously update all the extensions to the same version.
2. The same rule applies when downgrading; ensure that both the plugin and the extensions are reverted to matching versions.

Maintaining version consistency between the Typewriter plugin and its extensions is key to preventing compatibility issues and ensuring a smooth operation.
