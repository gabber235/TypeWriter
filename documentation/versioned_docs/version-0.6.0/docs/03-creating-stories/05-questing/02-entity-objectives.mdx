# Entity Objectives

:::info[Before starting]
We recommend reading the [Questing](./index.mdx) guide before starting this tutorial, as it provides essential background knowledge for understanding [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx).
:::

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create and implement [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx), a powerful feature that enhances player guidance to Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in your Minecraft Server.

## Understanding [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx)

[Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) are a specific quest objective that involve player interaction with NPCs.
These objectives add depth to Typewriters questing system by creating meaningful encounters and dialogues with characters in your world.
They can range from simple conversations to complex multi-stage interactions that drive your game's narrative forward.

Key benefits of using [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) include:
- Creating more immersive and interactive quest lines
- Guiding players through the game world in a natural, story-driven manner
- Providing visual cues to help players identify important NPCs

## Story Overview

Let's create a quest called _**"A Sip of Memories"**_ that showcases the use of entity objectives. This quest will guide the player through interactions with different NPCs to complete a heartwarming task.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuring the Quest

### Setup Pages
To bring our quest to life, we need to configure several pages that define the NPCs, their dialogues, and the quest structure.
These pages work together to create a cohesive quest experience:

<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_manifest.json"),
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_sequence.json"),
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_static.json"),
]} />

## Interact Entity Objective

[Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) are a powerful tool that allows you to create objectives that require players to interact with specific NPCs.
Here's how to set it up:

<EntrySearch entryName="interact_entity_objective"/>

In our _**"A Sip of Memories"**_ quest, we use multiple Interact Entity Objectives for different NPCs at various stages.
For example, we have separate objectives for talking to Elias at the beginning of the quest and when the player returns with the water.

### Visual Indicators

The [Interact Entity Objective](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) comes with built-in visual cues to guide players:

- When an objective is active for an NPC, an indicator appears above their head.
- The indicator changes based on whether the player has the quest tracked or not.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-4 md:space-y-0 md:flex-row md:space-x-4">
    <Figure title="NPC Indicator when Quest is Tracked" img={require("./assets/entity_objectives/npc_indicator_tracked.png")} alt="NPC Indicator Tracked" width={400} />
    <Figure title="NPC Indicator when Quest is Not Tracked" img={require("./assets/entity_objectives/npc_indicator_untracked.png")} alt="NPC Indicator Not Tracked" width={400} />
</div>

You can customize these indicators using [Snippets](../../05-helpfull-features/05-snippets.mdx) to match your game's aesthetic.

## Interact Entity Objectives Path Stream

To further assist players in navigating your game world, you can implement the [Interact Entity Objectives Path Stream](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objectives_path_stream.mdx). 
This feature creates a visual path, guiding players to NPCs with active [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) to those NPCs.

<EntrySearch entryName="interact_entity_objectives_path_stream"/>

Key features of the Path Stream:
- Automatically generates paths to all NPCs with active [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx).
- Only shows paths for objectives in currently tracked quests.
- Helps players navigate complex game environments more easily.

Here's a visual demonstration of the Path Stream in action:

<Player url={require("./assets/entity_objectives/path_stream.webm").default} />

## Quest Setup

To bring all these elements together and create our _**"A Sip of Memories"**_ quest, we use the following quest configuration:

<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_quest.json"),
]} referencePages={[
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_manifest.json"),
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_sequence.json"),
    require("./assets/entity_objectives/ent_obj_static.json"),
]} />

This configuration ties together the quest stages and objectives.

## Quest Demo

To see how all these elements come together in practice, check out this demonstration of the _**"A Sip of Memories"**_ quest:

<Player url={require("./assets/entity_objectives/quest_demo.webm").default} />

This demo showcases:
- How players interact with NPCs and their dialogues
- The visual indicators guiding players to objectives
- The flow of the quest from start to finish

By implementing [Interact Entity Objectives](../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/entries/quest/interact_entity_objective.mdx) in your quests, you can create rich, interactive experiences that helps guide players to where they need to go.
