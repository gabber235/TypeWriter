# Self Npc Cinematic 
import DeprecationWarning from '@site/src/components/DeprecationWarning';

<DeprecationWarning message='Use the EntityAdapter instead' />


The `Self NPC Cinematic` entry that plays a recorded animation back on the player with an NPC with the player's skin.
If the NPC recording does not have any armor, the player's armor when starting the cinematic will be used.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to create a cinematic where the player is talking to an NPC.
Like going in to a store and talking to the shopkeeper.
