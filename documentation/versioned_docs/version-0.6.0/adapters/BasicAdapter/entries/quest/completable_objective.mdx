# Completable Objective

The `Completable Objective` entry is an objective that can show a completed stage.
It is shown to the player when the show criteria are met, regardless of if the completed criteria are met.

## How could this be used?
This is useful when the quest has multiple objectives that can be completed in different orders.
For example, the player needs to collect wheat, eggs, and milk to make a cake.
The order in which the player collects the items does not matter.
But you want to show the player which items they have collected.
