# Game Time Audience 

The `GameTimeAudienceEntry` filters an audience based on the game time.

The total time of a Minecraft day is `24000` ticks.
Some examples of times are:
------------------------------
| Time of day | Ticks        |
|-------------|--------------|
| Dawn        | 0            |
| Noon        | 6000         |
| Dusk        | 12000        |
| Midnight    | 18000        |
------------------------------

## How could this be used?
This can be used to only allow passage to a certain area at night.
For example, a vampire castle that only opens its doors at night.
Or a market that only opens during the day.
