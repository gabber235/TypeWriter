# Countdown Fact

The `Cooldown Fact` is a fact reflects the time since the last set value.

When the value is set, it will count every second down from the set value.

Suppose the value is set to 10.
Then after 3 seconds, the value will be 7.

The countdown will continue regardless if the player is online/offline or if the server is online/offline.

## How could this be used?
This can be used to create a cooldown on a specific action.
For example, daily rewards that the player can only get once a day.
