# Player Kill Entity Event 

The `Player Kill Entity Event` is fired when a player kills an entity. If you want to detect when a player kills another player, use the [`Player Kill Player Event`](on_player_kill_player) instead.

## How could this be used?

This event could be used to detect when a player kills a boss, and give them some rewards. It could also be used to create a custom mob that drops items when killed by a player.
