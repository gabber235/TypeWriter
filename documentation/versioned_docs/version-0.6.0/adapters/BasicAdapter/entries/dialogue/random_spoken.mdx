# Random Spoken Dialogue 

The `Random Spoken Dialogue` action displays a randomly selected animated message to the player.

## How could this be used?

Let's say you have an NPC in your game who tells jokes to the player.
You could use the Random Spoken Dialogue action
to randomly select a joke from a list of possible jokes and have the NPC "tell"
it to the player using an animated message.
