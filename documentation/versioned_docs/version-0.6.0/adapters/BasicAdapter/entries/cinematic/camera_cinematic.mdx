# Camera Cinematic 

The `Camera Cinematic` entry is used to create a cinematic camera path.

Durations for path points calculated based on the total duration of each segment and specified path point's duration.
Suppose you have a segment with a duration of 300 ticks, and it has 3 path points.
Then we specify the duration on the second path point as 200 ticks.
The resulting durations between path points are as follows:

| From | To | Duration |
|------|----|----------|
| 1    | 2  | 100      |
| 2    | 3  | 200      |

::: warning
Since the duration of a path point is the duration from that point to the next point,
the last path point will always have a duration of `0`.
Regardless of the duration specified on the last path point.
:::

## How could this be used?
When you want to direct the player's attention to a specific object/location.
Or when you want to show off a build.
