# Interact Entity Objectives Path Stream

The `Interact Entity Objectives Path Stream` entry is a path stream that shows the path to each interact entity objective.
When the player has an interact entity objective, and the quest for the objective is tracked, a path stream will be displayed.

The `Ignore Instances` field is a list of entity instances that should be ignored when showing the path.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to show a path to each interacting entity objective in a quest.
