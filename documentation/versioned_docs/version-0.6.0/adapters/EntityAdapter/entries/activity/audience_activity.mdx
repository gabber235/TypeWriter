# Audience Activity 

The `Audience Activity` is an activity that filters an audience based on the audience a player is in.
The activity will go through the audiences in order and the first one
where the player is part of the audience will have the activity selected.

This can only be used on an individual entity instance.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to make a bodyguard distracted by something and walk away just for the player.
