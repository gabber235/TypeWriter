# Balance Group 

The `Balance Audience` is an group for which a player's balance meets a certain condition.
To determine if a player is part of this group, the balance of the player is checked for each condition.
The first condition that is met determines the group the player is part of.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to have facts that are specific to a player's balance, like a VIPs where all share some balance threshold.
