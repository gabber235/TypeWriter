# Player Near Location Event 

The `PlayerNearLocationEventEntry` class represents an event that is triggered when a player is within a certain range of a location.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to create immersive gameplay experiences such as triggering a special event or dialogue when a player approaches a specific location.
