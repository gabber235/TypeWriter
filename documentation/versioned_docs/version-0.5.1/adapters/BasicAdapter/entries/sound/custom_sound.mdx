# Custom Sound 

The `Custom Sound Entry` is an entry that allow you to add sounds from a resource pack.
And use it in other entries.

## How could this be used?
For npc's, for example, you can add a custom sound to the npc, every time the npc talks, the sound will play.
Or you can use it during cinematics where a ncp talks.
