# In Cinematic Fact 

The 'In Cinematic Fact' is a fact that returns 1 if the player has an active cinematic, and 0 if not.

If no cinematic is referenced, it will filter based on if any cinematic is active.

<fields.ReadonlyFactInfo />

## How could this be used?
With this fact, it is possible to make an entry only take action if the player does not have an active cinematic.
