# Trigger Sequence Cinematic 

The `Trigger Sequence Cinematic` entry that runs a sequence of triggers. It is very powerful but also very dangerous.

:::caution
Be aware of which triggers are running. If you run a trigger that is viewable by everyone, it will be visible to everyone.
Also, **never trigger dialogues**, they should not be triggered from a cinematic.
If you want to trigger a dialogue after the cinematic, connect it to the [CinematicEntry](../action/cinematic.mdx)
:::

## How could this be used?
When you want to use any triggerable entry. Like giving an item to the player at a specific frame.
