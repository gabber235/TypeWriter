# Simple Quest 

The `Quest` entry is a collection of tasks that the player can complete.
It is mainly for displaying the progress to a player.

It is **not** necessary to use this entry for quests.
It is just a visual novelty.

The entry filters the audience based on if the quest is active.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to show the progress of a quest to a player.
Connect objectives to the quest to show a player what they need to do.
