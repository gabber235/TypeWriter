# Group Members Path Stream

The `Group Members Path Stream` entry is a path stream that shows the path to each group member.
The 'Group Members' are determined by the group members that are in the same group as the player.

When the group is not set, the path stream will not display anything.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to show a path to each group member in a group of players.
When a player wants to find any other group member, they can follow the respective path.
