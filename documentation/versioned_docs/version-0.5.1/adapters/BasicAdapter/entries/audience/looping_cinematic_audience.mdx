# Looping Cinematic Audience

The `Looping Cinematic Audience` entry is used to show the audience members a cinematic that loops.

**It is recommended that this entry is bounded by location or region,
to prevent players from receiving packets for cinematics they cannot see.**

:::caution
The Cinematic can only have entries that are compatible with looping (non-primary entries).
Anything that cannot have two or more instances active at once will not work.
:::

## How could this be used?
To display particles on a loop, such as a fountain.
Or sparks that come from a broken wire.
