# Entity Adapter

The Entity Adapter contains all the essential entries working with entities.
It allows you to create dynamic entities such as NPC's or Holograms.

In most cases, it should be installed with Typewriter.
If you haven't installed Typewriter or the adapter yet,
please follow the [Installation Guide](../../docs/02-getting-started/01-installation.mdx)
first.
