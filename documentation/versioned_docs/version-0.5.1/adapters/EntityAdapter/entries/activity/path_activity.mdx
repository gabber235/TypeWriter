# Path Activity 

The `Path Activity` is an activity that moves along a predefined path.
The entity will move to each location in the set in order.
Once the entity reaches the last location, it will do the idle activity.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to have a tour guide that moves along the post-important paths.
