# Interacting with an entity
:::info[Before starting]
It's best to first read [Entities & NPC's](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to interact with an entity.

## Adding the entity interact event
First, we need to add the `Add On Entity Interact Event` entry to our sequence. This can be done by clicking on the + icon in the top right corner of the panel and searching for `Add On Entity Interact Event`. Add it to your page by clicking on the + icon.

<EntrySearch entryName="entity_interact_event"/>

### Selecting the definition
Now inside the inspector of the `New Entity Interact Event` at the definition field, select the definition of the entity you want to interact with. (For this tutorial that will be Oliver)

## Adding the event.
Now we need to add an event that gets triggered when the player interacts with the entity (For this tutorial we will use a spoken). Right-click on the `New Entity Interact Event` entry and click on `+ link with ...` to open the search menu. Search for `Add Spoken` and add it to the page.

<EntrySearch entryName="spoken"/>

Set the speaker to the oliver definition and text field to `Hello I am Oliver.`.

## Result
You can now publish your pages, and in-game, it should look like this when interacting with Oliver:

:::warning[Mc-Auth servers]
