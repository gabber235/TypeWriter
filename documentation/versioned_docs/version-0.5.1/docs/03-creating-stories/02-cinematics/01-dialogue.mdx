# Adding dialogues

It's best to first read [Cinematics](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.
:::
In this tutorial, you will learn how to add dialogues to your interactions.

## Adding a dialogue
In cinematic their are a variety of dialogues available like: `spoken`, `actionbar`, `title`, `subtitle`. For this tutorial we will use actionbar but all others have similar features.

First click on the + icon in the top right corner of the panel and search for `Add Actionbar Dialogue Cinematic`. Add it to your page by clicking on the + icon.
<EntrySearch entryName='actionbar_dialogue_cinematic'/>

### Configuring the dialogue
Now we need to configure the dialogue. 

First we need to add a [speaker](../01-interactions/index.mdx#configuring-the-speaker) to the dialogue. After that we need to add a segment this can be done by going to the operations and clicking on `Add Segment`.

### Configuring the dialogue segment
Now inside the segment you can go to the Text field and adding a text like `<white>This is a cool actionbar text!</white>`.
