# Dynamic Objectives

In some quests, the objectives need to progress forward and backwards based on the player's state. 
For example, the player needs to be in a certain region to continue.

## Adding the objective

For our quest, we want to change the objective based on if the player has the magnet boots equipped.

Since objectives are `Audience` entries, we can use the various `Audience` entries to show and hide the objectives.

To expand our quest, we will have the following objectives:

- When the player has not found the magnet boots, the objective is to __find a way to cross the chasm__.
- When the player has found the magnet boots, the objective is to __equip the magnet boots__.
- When the player has equipped the magnet boots, the objective is to __walk across the chasm__.

<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/dynamic_objectives/quest_manifest.json"),
    require("./assets/index/quest_static.json"),
]} />

This is what it looks like to play the quest:

<Player url={require("./assets/dynamic_objectives/quest_demo.webm").default} />
