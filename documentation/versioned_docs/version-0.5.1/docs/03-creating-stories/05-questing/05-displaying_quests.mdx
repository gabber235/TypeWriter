# Displaying Quests

Now that we've created our quest, we want to display it to the player.
First, we need to track the quest.

## Quest Tracking

Tracking a quest is for displaying the quest progress to the player.
Other entries can use the tracked quest to display information to the player.

:::warning Important
While many quests can be active at the same time, only **one** quest can be tracked at a time.
:::

You can manually track a quest with the `/tw quest track <quest_id>` command.
Or with the [Track Quest Action](../../../adapters/BasicAdapter/entries/action/track_quest.mdx) entry.

Additionally, Typewriter will automatically track quests when the quest becomes active.
Or when a objective becomes active and has a higher priority than the currently tracked quest.

## Placeholders

There are a few custom placeholders that can be used to display information to the player.

| Placeholder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `%typewriter_tracked_quest%` | The name of the tracked quest. |
| `%typewriter_tracked_objectives%` | A list of the objecteves of the tracked quest joined by a comma. |

## Sidebar

If Typewriter is managing your sidebar, you can use the [Objective Lines Entry](../../../adapters/BasicAdapter/entries/quest/objective_lines.mdx) to display the objectives of the tracked quest.

A possible setup for the sidebar could be:


<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/display/quest_display_manifest.json"),
]} />


## Quest Status Changes
#
You can also display when a quest becomes active or is completed.
Maybe by showing a title or particles.

A possible setup for this could be:

<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/display/quest_display_sequence.json"),
]} />
