# Giving items

:::info[Before starting]
It's best to first read [First Interaction](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.
:::
:::warning[1.20.5+]
In Minecraft version 1.20.5+, the item system will change, and this system will be deprecated until updated.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to give items in your interactions.

## Adding the give item

To add a give item entry, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on your entry and select `+ Link with ...`.
2. Search for `Add give item` and click on the + icon to add it to your sequence.

<EntrySearch entryName='give_item' />

## Configuring the give item

The giving item entry has two types of setting the item, by using the item capture or configuring it yourself.

### Using the item capture

The easy way is to use the item capture because it just copies the item that you are currently holding in-game to the panel. To do this, just click on the blue-white camera icon next to the `item` field.

<Player url={require("../../assets/interactions/item-capturer.webm").default} />

### Configuring it yourself

You can also configure the item yourself using the item editor. This can be done by opening the `item` field. You have six different things that you can configure:

1. **Material**: This is the item that the player will get.
2. **Amount**: The amount of items given to the player.
3. **Name**: This is the name of the item.
4. **Lore**: The lore of the item.
5. **Flags**: Specific options for the item.
6. **NBT**: Special data for the item.

## Result

After you configured your item, you can test your interaction by clicking the publish button, and then it should look something like this:

<Player url={require("../../assets/interactions/final-result-give-item.webm").default}/>
