# Adapters
## Introduction
TypeWriter is a dynamic platform that supports the development of adapters, which are modular components enhancing the overall functionality.
Adapters are self-contained, easily shareable, and integrate smoothly into the TypeWriter system.
They allow you to create custom entries and have them show up in the web panel.
This guide is tailored to guide you through the process of creating an adapter, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

:::info
It is highly recommended to write adapters in Kotlin, as it is the primary language of TypeWriter. **Though, it is currently possible to write adapters in Java, this will no longer be possible in v0.6.**
