# Creating an Adapter
## Introduction
Typewriter is a dynamic platform that supports the development of adapters, which are modular components enhancing the overall functionality.
Adapters are self-contained, easily shareable, and integrate smoothly into the TypeWriter system.
They allow you to create custom entries and have them show up in the web panel.
This guide is tailored to guide you through the process of creating an adapter, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Prerequisites
 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher.
 - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
 - A basic understanding of Gradle and the Spigot API.

## Step 1: Setting Up a Gradle Project
Begin by establishing a Gradle project for your Typewriter adapter. Below is a comprehensive setup for your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.0.0"
    id("io.github.goooler.shadow") version "8.1.7"
}

// Replace with your own information
group = "me.yourusername"
version = "0.0.1"

repositories {
    // Typewriter required repositories
    mavenCentral()
    maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
    maven("https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-releases/")
    maven("https://repo.opencollab.dev/maven-snapshots/")
    maven("https://jitpack.io")

    // Add other necessary repositories
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.gabber235:typewriter:main-SNAPSHOT") // Latest release version

    // Add other dependencies as needed
}

tasks.withType<ShadowJar> {
    exclude("kotlin/**")
    exclude("META-INF/maven/**")
    // Important: Use the relocated commandapi which is shadowed by the plugin
    relocate("dev.jorel.commandapi", "com.github.gabber235.typewriter.extensions.commandapi") {
        include("dev.jorel.commandapi.**")
    }
}

kotlin {
    jvmToolchain(21)
}
```

Ensure to replace placeholders like `me.yourusername` with your project details.

### Choosing the TypeWriter Version
Select the appropriate TypeWriter dependency version:
For stable and tested features, use the latest release version:
```kotlin
compileOnly("com.github.gabber235:typewriter:main-SNAPSHOT")
```
This is suitable for most development needs and is recommended for general adapter creation.

If you need the latest features and improvements (which might be unstable), use the latest development version:
```kotlin
compileOnly("com.github.gabber235:typewriter:develop-SNAPSHOT")
```
Note that this version may include changes that are not yet fully tested or documented.

If you need a specific version, visit the [JitPack page](https://jitpack.io/#gabber235/typewriter) and select the version you need.

## Step 2: Creating an Adapter Class
After setting up your project, create an adapter class. Here's an example:

<CodeSnippet tag="adapter" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

## Step 3: Building the Adapter
After creating the adapter class, build the adapter. This can be done by running the `shadowJar` Gradle task.
This will generate a JAR file in the `build/libs` directory. 
This JAR file can be used as an adapter in TypeWriter.
Place the JAR file in the `plugins/TypeWriter/adapters` directory and restart the server.
Typewriter will automatically load the adapter and run it.

If any problems occur, check the console for errors and ensure that the adapter is properly configured.
