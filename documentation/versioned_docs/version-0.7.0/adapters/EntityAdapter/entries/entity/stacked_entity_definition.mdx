# Stacked Entity Definition

The `StackedEntityDefinition` class is an entry that represents a stacking of entities.

:::caution
All properties will be shared between all entities.
Even if it is defined on only one entity.
:::

Only the bottom entity will have the location of the `StackedEntity` instance.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to stack entities on top of each other.
Like having a hologram above a mob.

<fields.EntryField name='Definitions' required multiple>
