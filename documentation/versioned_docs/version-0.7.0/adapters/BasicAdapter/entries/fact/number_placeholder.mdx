# Number Placeholder Fact 

A [fact](/docs/creating-stories/facts) that is computed from a placeholder.
This placeholder is evaluated when the fact is read and must return a number or boolean.

<fields.ReadonlyFactInfo />

## How could this be used?

Make sure the player has a high enough level.
Then allow them to start a quest or enter a dungeon.


## Fields

<fields.CommentField />
<fields.EntryField name='Group' required>
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Placeholder' required placeholders>
     The placeholder to parse.
For example %player_level%.

<Admonition type="caution">
Only placeholders that return a number or boolean are supported!
If you want to use a placeholder that returns a string,
use the <Link to='value_placeholder'>ValuePlaceholderFactEntry</Link> instead.
</Admonition>
</fields.EntryField>
