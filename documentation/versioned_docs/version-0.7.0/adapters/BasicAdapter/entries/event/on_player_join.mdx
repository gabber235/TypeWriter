# Player Join Event 

The `Player Join Event` event is called when a player joins the server.

## How could this be used?

This could be used with [facts](/docs/creating-stories/facts) to give a new player a welcome message, or welcome back new players. You can also use it to give new players a starting item, or to give them a starting amount of money with the [Vault adapter](/adapters/VaultAdapter).
