# Giving items

:::info[Before starting]
It's best to first read [First Interaction](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to give items in your interactions.

## Adding the give item

To add a give item entry, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on your entry and select `+ Link with ...`.
2. Search for `Add give item` and click on the + icon to add it to your sequence.

<EntrySearch entryName='give_item' />

## Configuring the give item

The giving item entry has two types of giving an item: A custom item and a Serialized item.

### Differences
<Tabs groupId="Differences" queryString>
  <TabItem value="custom-item" label="Custom Item" default>
    The custom item allows you to customize almost all the aspects of the item.
    :::warning[NBT]
    A custom item can't contain NBT data.
    :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="serialized-item" label="Serialized Item" default>
    The serialized item gives you the ability to use the Item Capturer and capture the item from in-game.
    :::warning[Not Editable]
    You can't edit a serialized item. Only the name can be changed.
    :::
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using the Item Capturer(Serialized Item)

The easy way is to use the item capture because it just copies the item that you are currently holding in-game to the panel. To do this, just click on <ActionButton button='capture'/> icon next to the `item` field.

<Player url={require("../../assets/interactions/item-capturer.webm").default} />

### Configuring it yourself(Custom Item)

You can also configure the item yourself. Inside the item field select `Custom Item`. Press the + icon right next to the `Components(0)` text to add one of the following components:
1. **Amount**: The amount of items given to the player.
2. **Flag**: Specific options for the item.
3. **Lore**: The lore of the item.
4. **Material**: This is the item that the player will get.
5. **Item Name**: This is the name of the item.

## Result

After you configured your item, you can test your interaction by clicking the publish button, and then it should look something like this:

<Player url={require("../../assets/interactions/final-result-give-item.webm").default}/>
