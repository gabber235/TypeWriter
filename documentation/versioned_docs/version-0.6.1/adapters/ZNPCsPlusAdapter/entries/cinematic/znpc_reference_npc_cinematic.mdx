# Reference Npc Cinematic 
import DeprecationWarning from '@site/src/components/DeprecationWarning';

<DeprecationWarning message='Use the EntityAdapter instead' />


The `Reference NPC Cinematic` entry that plays a recorded animation back on a reference NPC.
When active, the original NPC will be hidden and a clone will be spawned in its place.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to create a cinematic where the player is talking to an NPC.
Like going in to a store and talking to the shopkeeper.
