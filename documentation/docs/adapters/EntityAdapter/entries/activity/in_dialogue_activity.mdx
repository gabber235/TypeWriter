# In Dialogue Activity 

The `InDialogueActivityEntry` is an activity that activates child activities when a player is in a dialogue with the NPC.

The activity will only activate when the player is in a dialogue with the NPC.

## How could this be used?
This can be used to stop a npc from moving when a player is in a dialogue with it.
