# Game Time Activity 

The `GameTimeActivityEntry` is an activity that activates child activities at specific times in the game.

The total time of a Minecraft day is `24000` ticks.
Some examples of times are:
------------------------------
| Time of day | Ticks        |
|-------------|--------------|
| Dawn        | 0            |
| Noon        | 6000         |
| Dusk        | 12000        |
| Midnight    | 18000        |
------------------------------

## How could this be used?

This can be used to create schedules for npc's to follow.
For example, going to the market in the morning, going to the tavern at night.
