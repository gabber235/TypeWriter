# Run Command Event 

The `Run Command Event` event is triggered when a command is run. This event can be used to add custom commands to the server.

:::caution
This event is used for commands that **do not** already exist. If you are trying to detect when a player uses an already existing command, use the [`Detect Command Ran Event`](on_detect_command_ran) instead.
