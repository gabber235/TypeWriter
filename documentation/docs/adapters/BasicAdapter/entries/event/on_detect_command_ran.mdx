# Detect Command Ran Event 

The `Detect Command Ran Event` event is triggered when an **already existing** command is ran.

:::caution
This event only works if the command already exists. If you are trying to make a new command that does not exist already, use the [`Run Command Event`](on_run_command) instead.
:::

## How could this be used?

This event could be used to trigger a response when a specific command has been run.
For example, you could have a command that sends a message to a channel when a command has been run,
which could be used as an audit log for your admins.


## Fields

<fields.EntryField name='Triggers' required multiple>
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Command' required regex>
     The command to listen for.
This can be partial, so if you wanted to listen for any warp command,
you could use <code>warp</code> as the command.
However, this can also include parameters, so if you
wanted to listen if the player warps to spawn, you could use
<code>warp spawn</code> as the command.
<br />
<Admonition type="caution">
Do not include the <code>/</code> at the start of the command.
This will be added automatically.
</Admonition>
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Cancel' required>
     Cancel the event when triggered
</fields.EntryField>
