# Tracked Quest Audience

The `Tracked Quest Audience` entry filters an audience based on if they have a quest tracked.

If no quest is referenced, it will filter based on if any quest is tracked.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to show a boss bar or sidebar based on if a player has a quest tracked.


## Fields

<fields.EntryField name='Children' required multiple>
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Quest' required>
     When not set it will filter based on if any quest is tracked.
</fields.EntryField>
