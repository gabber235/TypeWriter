# Location Objective 

The `LocationObjective` entry is a task that the player can complete by reaching a specific location.
It is mainly for displaying the progress to a player.

It is **not** necessary to use this entry for objectives.
It is just a visual novelty.

The entry filters the audience based on if the objective is active.
It will show the objective to the player if the criteria are met.

It allows path streams to be displayed to the target location.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to guide the players to a specific location.
Showing the players where they need to go with a path stream.
