# Cinematic 

The `Cinematic` action is used to start a new cinematic.

A cinematic can only be overridden
if another cinematic is triggered with a higher page priority than the current one.

## How could this be used?

This action can be useful in situations where you want to start a cinematic.
See the [Cinematic](/docs/first-cinematic) tutorial for more information.
