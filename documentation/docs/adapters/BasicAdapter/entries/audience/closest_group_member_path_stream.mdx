# Closest Group Member Path Stream

The `Closest Group Member Path Stream` entry is a path stream that shows the path to the closest group member.
The 'Closest Group Member' is determined by the group member that is closest to the player geographically,
**Not based on the path distance.**

When the group is not set, the path stream will not display anything.
Players must be in the same world for the path stream to consider them.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to show a path to the closest group member in a group of players.
When a player is lost, they can follow the path to the closest group member.
