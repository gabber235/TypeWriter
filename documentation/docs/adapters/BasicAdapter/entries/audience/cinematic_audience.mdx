# Cinematic Audience 

The `Cinematic Audience` entry filters an audience based on if they are in a cinematic.

If no cinematic is referenced, it will filter based on if any cinematic is active.

## How could this be used?
This could be used to hide the sidebar or boss bar when a cinematic is playing.
