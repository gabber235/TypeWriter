# Quest Status Fact

The `QuestStatusFact` is a fact that returns the status of a specific quest.

<fields.ReadonlyFactInfo />

| Status | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Inactive | 0 |
| Active | 1 |
| Active and Tracked | 2 |
| Completed | -1 |

:::warning
The __completed__ status has a value of **-1**, this is to make it easy to query if the quest is active by `>= 1`.
:::

## How could this be used?

This can be used to abstract the status of a quest.
If a quest has multiple criteria, you can check for this fact instead of checking for each criterion.
