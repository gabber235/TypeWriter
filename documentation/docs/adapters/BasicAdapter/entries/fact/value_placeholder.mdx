# Value Placeholder Fact 

A [fact](/docs/facts) that is computed from a placeholder.
This placeholder is evaluated when the fact is read and can return anything.
The value will be computed based on the `values` specified.
<fields.ReadonlyFactInfo/>

## How could this be used?

If you only want to run certain actions if the player is in creative mode.
Or depending on the weather, change the dialogue of the NPC.


## Fields

<fields.CommentField />
<fields.EntryField name='Group' required>
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Placeholder' required placeholders>
     Placeholder to parse (e.g. %player_gamemode%
</fields.EntryField>
<fields.EntryField name='Values' required map regex>
     The values to match the placeholder with and their corresponding fact value.

An example would be:
```yaml
values:
SURVIVAL: 0
CREATIVE: 1
ADVENTURE: 2
SPECTATOR: 3
```
If the placeholder returns `CREATIVE`, the fact value will be `1`.

If no value matches, the fact value will be `0`.
