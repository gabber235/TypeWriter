# Mythic Skill Cinematic 

The `Mythic Skill Cinematic` cinematic entry triggers a skill during a cinematic.

:::caution
A skill itself needs to define the group to be self using `group=self`

### Example:
```
- effect:particlesphere{particle=flame;amount=200;radius=2;group=self} @self
```
:::

## How could this be used?

This can be used to animate fancy particle effects during a cinematic.
