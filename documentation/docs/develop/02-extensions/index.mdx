# Extensions
## Introduction
TypeWriter is a dynamic platform that supports the development of extensions, which are modular components enhancing the overall functionality.
Extensions are self-contained, easily shareable, and integrate smoothly into the TypeWriter system.
They allow you to create custom entries and have them show up in the web panel.
This guide is tailored to guide you through the process of creating an extension, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
