# Query Entries

Sometimes you need to find an entry by any of it's fields or by type. This can be done with the `Query` class.

If you need to find all entries of a specific type:
```kotlin
val entries = Query.find<MyEntry>()
```

Sometimes you need it by a specific criteria:
```kotlin
val entries = Query.findWhere<MyEntry> {
    it.someField == "some value"
}
```

You can also find a single entry:
```kotlin
val entry = Query.findFirstWhere<MyEntry> {
    it.someField == "some value"
}
```

Sometimes you need to find an entry by it's id:
```kotlin
val entry = Query.findById<MyEntry>(id)
```

Other times you need to find entries by their page:
```kotlin
val entries = Query.findWhereFromPage<MyEntry>(pageId) {
    it.someField == "some value"
}
```
