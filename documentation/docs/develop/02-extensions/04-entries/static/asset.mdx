# AssetEntry
The AssetEntry is a specialized interface that extends the `StaticEntry`.
It is primarily used for handling static assets within the game. 
Assets can include various types of files such as images, sounds, or other external resources that are crucial to enhancing the game environment and player experience.
The key attribute of AssetEntry is the path, which specifies the location of the asset.

## Usage
Here's a generic example of creating and using an `AssetEntry`:

### Defining an AssetEntry
<CodeSnippet tag="asset_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

### Accessing the Artifact's Content

To get the asset from the entry, you can use the following code:

<CodeSnippet tag="asset_access" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
