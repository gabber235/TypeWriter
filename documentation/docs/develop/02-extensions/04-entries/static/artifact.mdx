# ArtifactEntry

The `ArtifactEntry` is a specialized interface derived from `AssetEntry`.
Its primary purpose is to handle artifacts, which are assets generated by the extensions.
Unlike standard assets, artifacts are usually dynamic and created during runtime.
This makes them particularly useful for storing data that changes based on player interactions or game events.

An essential feature of `ArtifactEntry` is its unique `artifactId`.
This identifier must remain constant once assigned and is used to reference the artifact within the plugin.

## Usage 

Here's a generic example of creating and using an `ArtifactEntry`:

### Defining an ArtifactEntry

<CodeSnippet tag="artifact_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

### Accessing the Artifact's Content
<CodeSnippet tag="artifact_access" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

In this example, we get the content of the given artifact reference by using the `AssetManager`.
The `assetManager.fetchAsset` method is then used to retrieve the content of the artifact, based the `entry`.
