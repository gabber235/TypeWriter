# EventEntry

The `EventEntry` is used as a starting point for any sequence. It can have external event listeners listening to events and trigger based on that.

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="event_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

To listen to an event, you must create a function that is annotated with `@EntryListener`. 
The great thing about kotlin, is that this can be done in the same file as the entry.
<CodeSnippet tag="event_entry_listener" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

The function will automatically be registered as a listener for the event by Typewriter and be called when the Bukkit event is trigger.
An optional `Query` parameter can be added to easily fetch all the different event entries.

## Entry Context Variables
Sometimes you want to pass some information to the context so that subsequent entries can use it.

<CodeSnippet tag="event_entry_with_context_keys" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
