# Panel Loading Issues Troubleshooting Guide

Are you encountering difficulties with the Typewriter plugin's panel not loading? This guide will help you troubleshoot and ensure the correct setup for optimal functionality.

## Assigning Ports Correctly

If the panel isn't loading, a common issue could be the lack of assigned ports. The Typewriter plugin requires two open ports:

1. One port for the panel to load.
2. Another port for the websocket to communicate with the server.

:::warning
Hosting platforms like Aternos, which only offer a single port, are not compatible with the Typewriter plugin due to this requirement.

## Using the Correct URL

Ensure that you are using the correct URL to access the panel. The format should be either `ip:port` or, if you're using a subdomain, `url:port`. Using the correct URL is crucial for accessing the panel successfully.

## Avoiding Duplicate Ports in Config

A common mistake is including the port in the `hostname` field of the `config.yml` file. 
The hostname should only be the IP address or the domain name. It should not contain the port.
Here's an example:

```yaml title="config.yml"
# ...
// highlight-red
hostname: "127.0.0.1:25565" // Incorrect line
// highlight-green
hostname: "127.0.0.1"       // Correct line
# ...
```

Removing the port from the hostname field can resolve issues related to the panel not loading.
