## What is Playit.gg
Playit.gg is a service that allows you to make your localhost minecraft server be public for anyone to connect. This is useful for testing your server with friends or for making a public server for a short period of time.

## How to make typewriter work with playit.gg
First go to [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) and have a agent created and your minecraft server connected. There are plenty of tutorials out on the internet on how to do this.

### Creating a new tunnel
Inside the tunnels tab you can click on `+ Add tunnel`.

Than inside the popup select your region and use the Tunnel Type `TCP (protocol)` than set the local port to `8080`(or the port you configured in the config.yml) and click on `Add tunnel`.
