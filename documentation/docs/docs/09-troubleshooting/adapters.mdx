# Adapters Troubleshooting 

Experiencing issues with your Typewriter plugin adapters? This guide provides step-by-step instructions to ensure your adapters are set up correctly and functioning optimally with the Typewriter plugin.

## Correct Adapter Placement

It's important to note that adapters for the Typewriter plugin are not standard Spigot plugins. They are special JAR files exclusively for Typewriter, and thus need to be stored separately. To ensure proper functioning:

1. Navigate to the plugin directory: `/plugins/Typewriter/adapters`.
2. If an "adapters" folder does not exist within this directory, create one.
3. Place your adapter files inside this "adapters" folder.

This dedicated folder ensures that Typewriter can correctly read and use these adapters without confusing them with regular Spigot plugins.

## Adapter and Plugin Version Compatibility

For the Typewriter plugin and its adapters to work harmoniously, they must be on the same version. This is crucial for both updating and downgrading:

1. When updating the `typewriter.jar` file, simultaneously update all the adapters to the same version.
2. The same rule applies when downgrading; ensure that both the plugin and the adapters are reverted to matching versions.

Maintaining version consistency between the Typewriter plugin and its adapters is key to preventing compatibility issues and ensuring a smooth operation.
