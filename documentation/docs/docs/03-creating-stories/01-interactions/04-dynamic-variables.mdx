# Random Dialogue
:::info[Before starting]
This tutorial builds upon the [first interaction](./index.mdx) tutorial. It is also best to first read the [Facts](../03-facts/index.mdx) documentation.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use dynamic variables and create a random spoken using them.

## Creating random dialogue
First, you need to open the inspector of the spoken you created from the [first interaction](./index.mdx) tutorial. Then click on the <ActionButton button='dynamic-variable'/> just above the Text field and click on `Add random Variable`. 

<EntrySearch entryName='random_variable' />

This will create a random variable inside a static page.

## Configuring the random variable
After creating the random variable, open the inspector of the random variable. Here, you can add multiple values to the random variable. Now, every time a spoken is triggered, a different message will be displayed from that random variable.\
For this tutorial, we chose to add the following lines, but this can be anything you want:\
`Hello! I am a flower.`, `Wow, you found me.`, `Hey you!`\
Your dynamic variable should now look like:
<Image img={require("../../assets/interactions/random-variable.png")} alt="Random Variable Example" width={400}/>

## Removing the random variable
To remove a dynamic variable, just click on the <ActionButton button='remove'/> icon next to the dynamic variable.

## Result
Now, every time the spoken is triggered, a random message will be displayed from the random variable.
