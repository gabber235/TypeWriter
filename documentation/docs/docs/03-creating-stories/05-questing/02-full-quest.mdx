# Kill Quest Guide
:::info[Before starting]
It is best to read the [Interactions](../01-interactions/index.mdx),
[facts](../03-facts/index.mdx), and [Questing](./index.mdx) documentation before starting this guide.
A sequence, static and manifest page should also be created already.
:::
:::warning[Complete guide]
This guide is made to showcase the complete use of TypeWriter, and its system.
To grasp the concept of this guide, make sure to thoroughly read it.
:::
In this guide, you will learn how to create a quest where the player needs to kill x amount of a certain mob.

## Configuring the manifest page
:::info[Manifest]
This section of the guide already assumes you have created a manifest page.
:::
First we will need to create a quest. This can be done by doing the following steps:

### Adding the quest entry
This can be done by going to the manifest page and clicking on the `+` icon in the top right corner of the panel. Search for `Add Quest` and add it to your page by clicking on the `+` icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='quest'/>

### Configuring the quest
After creating the quest open the inspector and follow the following steps

#### Setting the display name
Set the Display Name field to `Guide Quest`. This will be the name of the quest that will be displayed to the player.

#### Configuring the criteria
Click on the `+` icon in the inspector next to the Active Criteria field. Then, you can select the fact you want to use. For this guide, we will use a permanent fact called `Guide Kill` with the group set to a player group.\
* For the Active Criteria set the value to `<` and the value to `4`. Create another active criteria with the same fact but set the value to `!=` and the value to `0`.
* For the Completed Criteria set the value to `==` and the value to `4`.

Your quest should now look like this:
<EntryNodeInspector entryId="3JREccxRRKxn8UO" pages={questPages} />

### Adding the objective
Now we have created our quest we can begin with creating the objective. This can be done by clicking on the `+` icon in the top right corner of the panel and searching for `Add Completable Objective`. Add it to your page by clicking on the `+` icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='completable_objective'/>

### Configuring the objective
After creating the objective create a new permanent fact and give it a name, for this guide we will be using a zombie so we will be using the name `killed_zombies` and link it with the player group. Now configure the objective as the following:
<EntryNodeInspector entryId="zWK21mcvT1HpoSu" pages={questPages} />

## Configuring the sequence page
:::info[First interaction]
This section of the guide already assumes you have created a sequence page with a trigger event.
:::
### Adding the quest track entry
Now we need to add a `Track Quest` entry to our sequence page. This can be done by clicking on the `+` icon in the top right corner of the panel and searching for `Track Quest`. Add it to your page by clicking on the `+` icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='track_quest'/>

After creating the quest track open the inspector and select the guide quest at the `Quest` field. Now your inspector should look like this:
<EntryNodeInspector entryId="tUaei0LbNfz8acp" pages={questPages} />

### Adding the `On Player Kill Entity` event
Now we need to add a `On Player Kill Entity` event to our sequence page. This can be done by clicking on the `+` icon in the top right corner of the panel and searching for `On Player Kill Entity`. Add it to your page by clicking on the `+` icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='on_player_kill_entity'/>

Now inside the inspector, you can configure the entity you want to use. For this guide, we will be using a zombie.

### Adding a simple action entry
Now right-click on the kill event and search for `Add Simple Action`. Add it to your page by clicking on the `+` icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='simple_action'/>

Now inside the inspector, create a new modifier and set the fields:
* Fact: `killed_zombies`
* Operator: `+`
* Value: `1`

## Full Result
Now all your pages should look like this:
<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/full_tutorial/sequence.json"),
    require("./assets/full_tutorial/manifest.json"),
    require("./assets/full_tutorial/static.json")
]} />
