# Cinematics

:::info[Before starting]
This guide assumes that you have already installed the [Basic Adapter](../../02-getting-started/01-installation.mdx#basic-adapter).\
Also, make sure you have read the [layout](../../02-getting-started/02-layout.mdx) documentation and created a **cinematic** page.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and view cinematics in your interactions!

## What are cinematics?
Cinematics are timed sequences of actions that can be played in your interactions. They are used to create cutscenes or other timed events.

## Creating a cinematic
Let's get started by creating a simple camera cinematic.

### Adding a camera cinematic
Firstly click on the + icon in the top right corner of the panel and search for `Add Camera Cinematic`. Add it to your page by clicking on the + icon.

### Creating a segment
Now we need to add a segment to our track. You can do this by clicking on the `New Camera Cinematic` entry in your page and by operations clicking on `Add Segment`(1).

![Segments](../../assets/cinematics/segments.png)

After you create the segment, you can click on it (2). This opens the inspector of the segment.

### Modifying the camera segment
In a camera cinematic segment, you have a path. Each path contains a list of locations in a world of your server. When multiple locations are specified on a path, the player will move between them. If only one is specified, the player will stay stationary.
To create a path, click on the + icon in the inspector at `path(0)`.

To set a location in a path, you have 2 options: using the content mode or configuring it yourself.
#### Using the content mode 
The content mode allows you to get the player's current location and fill in the fields for you.
<Player url={require("../../assets/cinematics/content-mode.webm").default} />

#### Configuring it yourself
You can also configure the paths yourself. This can be done by opening the `Path #1` field. In there, you can configure the location of the path. These are:
* **World**: The world where the cinematic happens.
* **X**: The x coordinate of the location.
* **Y**: The y coordinate of the location.
* **Z**: The z coordinate of the location.
* **Pitch**: The pitch of the camera.
* **Yaw**: The yaw of the camera.

**Duration**: The duration of the location to the next location in ticks. If not specified, the duration will be calculated based on the left-over duration.\
For example, if you have a segment of *300* frames with 3 locations, and the 2nd location has a **duration** of *200* frames, the duration from the 1st to the 2nd location will be *100* ticks, and from the 2nd to the 3rd location, *200* ticks.

Repeat this process to make more locations in the path.

## result
For the result we are going to use the example for the duration. You can easily view your cinematic by running the command:\
 `/tw cinematic start (page name)` or adding an `Add cinematic` to a sequence page.
