/**
 * The `Self NPC Cinematic` entry that plays a recorded animation back on the player with an NPC with the player's skin.
 * If the NPC recording does not have any armor, the player's armor when starting the cinematic will be used.
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 *
 * This could be used to create a cinematic where the player is talking to an NPC.
 * Like going in to a store and talking to the shopkeeper.
