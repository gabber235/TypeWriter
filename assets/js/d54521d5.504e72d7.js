Below are the highlights:\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Critical Changes\\n\\n### From Adapters to Extensions\\n   Typewriter has transitioned from using `Adapters` to `Extensions`, marking a significant evolution in how custom functionality is integrated. Key improvements with this change include:\\n   - **Gradle Plugin for Extensions**: A new Gradle plugin simplifies the process of developing Extensions, making setup and management easier for developers.\\n   - **Compile-Time Discovery**: Discovery of Extension internals, such as entries, now occurs at compile-time instead of runtime. This not only future-proofs Typewriter but also lays the groundwork for the upcoming marketplace, where entries in each Extension will be viewable without running the Extension.\\n   - **Hot Reloading**: Extensions can now be reloaded on-the-fly using `/tw reload`, enabling real-time updates without the need for a server restart.\\n   - **Optimized Loading**: Only the necessary classes are loaded from Extensions. For example, if an Extension contains thousands of entries but only one is used, Typewriter loads only that specific entry, enhancing memory and processing efficiency.\\n   - **Extension Validators**: Built-in validators now check Extensions against Typewriter\u2019s standards, helping to ensure reliability and consistency across user-created Extensions.\\n\\n### New Item System \\n   Typewriter introduces a completely new item system, which is **incompatible with previously defined items**. Users will need to recreate items to align with the new structure. Based on user feedback, no migrator will be provided, as the majority found it unnecessary. **Please test this update on a development server before upgrading your production environment.**\\n\\n## Important Features\\n\\n1. **Skip Cinematic Segments**  \\n   A new `SkipCinematicEntry` gives players the option to skip sections of cinematics by pressing a configured key, offering more control over in-game cinematic experiences.\\n\\n2. **UI and Web Panel Upgrades**  \\n   Improvements to the web panel and UI components provide a smoother experience. These upgrades include the ability to unselect Sound IDs, layout enhancements, compatibility improvements behind reverse proxies, and visual indicators for empty fields, all of which contribute to a more intuitive and flexible panel.\\n\\n## New Entries\\n\\n- **Cinematic Entries**: `GameTimeCinematicEntry`, `WeatherCinematicEntry`, `SkipCinematicEntry`, `BlockCommandCinematicEntry`\\n- **Dialogue**: `ActionbarDialogueEntry`, `SimpleMessageActionEntry`\\n- **Entity and Activity Entries**: `MythicMobKillPlayerEventEntry`, `RemovePotionEffectActionEntry`, `LookAtBlockActivity`, `LookAtPitchYawActivity`, `RandomPatrolActivity`, `AmbientSoundActivity`, `ScaleData`, `InteractionEntity`, `PillagerEntity`, `VindicatorEntity`, `Llama Entity`\\n- **Miscellaneous**: `WeatherAudienceEntry`, `FireworkActionEntry` (with `flight duration` setting)\\n\\n**If you consider Typewriter to be valuable to your server, please consider [Sponsoring the Project](https://github.com/sponsors/gabber235)**"},{"id":"0.5.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/devlog/0.5.0-release","source":"@site/devlog/releases/2024-08-10-0.5.0-release.mdx","title":"Manifesting Stories Update","description":"Since this update is so big, it is almost impossible to list every change.

Think of showing NPCs based on filters (such as quest status) and having NPC holograms. Boss bars, Creating scoreboards, Interaction zones, and much more!\\n\\n_For the programmers under us, where sequence entries are like imperative programming. Manifest entries are declarative programming. They can be linked in an acyclic-directional graph._\\n\\n### Audience Entries\\nThe first subclass of Manifest Entries are Audience Entries.\\nThey display anything to the player, Such as a boss bar. There is a special variety of audience entries, which are AudienceFilterEntries. They filter out players, such as regions, if they are in a certain part of a quest, if they are in a cinematic...\\nThese types of filters can be chained to have extreme customizability and flexibility.\\n\\n## Entity Adapter\\nSay goodbye to the old NPC adapters like Citizens, FancyNpcs, and ZNPCs. The Entity Adapter allows you to define entities directly within Typewriter, empowering you to use them in cinematics, control their visibility based on conditions (like during a quest segment), and even have them navigate and exhibit complex behaviors. With full control, the sky is the limit!\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ny-OhrV5FQQ?si=dqzetbInKE6jxRjy\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n## Road Network\\nYou can now create **Road Networks** in Typewriter.\\nThese allow NPCs to navigate through the world and show Path Streams to guide the players.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVKGS70PEq4?si=FdXpg4lVTRMtU7lu\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n## Grouped Facts\\nThe value of a fact can now be set for a group of players. \\nFor example, you can now check if a party of players have killed a certain number of enemies.\\n\\n## Documentation Improvements\\nSome of you may have already looked at the new documentation. \\nWe\'ve made major improvements to the documentation. All to make it easier to use and understand Typewriter.\\n\\n## Switched from ProtocolLib to PacketEvents\\nThis switch has allowed many new features in Typewriter, like the new buttery smooth camera cinematics. It means that now you need to install PacketEvents in order for Typewriter to work.\\n\\n## Made some breaking API changes \\nThere are various breaking API changes for Adapters. To view the migration, take a look at the [Migration Guide](https://docs.typewritermc.com/develop/adapters/api-changes/0.5.0)\\n\\n:::danger[Deprecation Warning]\\nWith this release, we\'re marking the old NPC adapters, such as ZNPCs and FancyNpcs, as deprecated. This means that while they will still function in the current version, this will be the last release where they are supported. Though only the files added here will work. Going forward, we\'ll only be providing bug fixes for the Citizens NPC adapter. It will remain updated primarily to assist new users in getting started, but we strongly encourage everyone to transition to the Entity Adapter for the best Typewriter experience.\\n:::"},{"id":"documentation-improvements","metadata":{"permalink":"/devlog/documentation-improvements","source":"@site/devlog/2024-07-31-Documentation-improvements.mdx","title":"Documentation Improvements","description":"Hey reader, and fellow members!

My name is Gabber235, and for the past 10 years I\'ve been creating Minecraft content. I\'ve made a variety of different projects, from simple tweaks to complex interactions. And while I\'ve always enjoyed creating these projects, I\'ve always found that creating custom player interactions was a pain.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## The problem\\nYou see, I love telling stories in Minecraft. Bringing my wildest ideas to life in a virtual world is one of my greatest joys. \\nHowever, actually creating these stories was a different story \u{1F606}. Not only did it require a lot of time and effort, but I also had to be an expert coder to make anything happen.\\n\\n## How does Typewriter help?\\nWith Typewriter, I wanted to provide a tool that was accessible and easy to use, even for those who have no coding experience. I wanted to help reduce the complexity and time required to create custom player interactions, allowing server owners to focus on other aspects of their projects. Letting them create the stories they want to tell, without having to worry about the technical side of things.\\n\\n## There are already a lot of tools out there, why create another one?\\nNow, I know what you\'re thinking. \\"But Gabber, why not just use an existing tool?\\" Well, I tried. But I always found that existing tools were either too complex, requiring you to navigate way to many YAML files, or not flexible enough, leaving me with untold possibilities.\\nThat is why I created Typewriter, a tool that is easy to use, but also flexible enough to be used for a variety of different Minecraft projects, from simple tweaks to complex interactions. With a unique web panel and a powerful API, Typewriter is the perfect tool for creating custom player interactions.\\n\\n## Yes I am sold, but how do I get started?\\nWell, I\'m glad you asked! You can get started by visiting the [Documentation](https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/home).\\nThere you can find a variety of different resources, from a [Installation Guide](https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/installation-guide) to creating your [First interaction](https://docs.typewritermc.com/docs/first-interaction) that will help you get started with Typewriter.\\nYou can also find a [discord server](https://discord.gg/gs5QYhfv9x) where you can get help from the community and the developers."}]}}')}}]);
