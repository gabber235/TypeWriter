// Organization membership management includes the live membership projection,
// role assignment controls, and responsive member administration screens.
//
// The application providers own the client side projection and route mutations
// through the organization protocol. Presentation widgets only own transient
// selection, focus, and expansion state, then delegate durable changes back to
// those providers. Join codes and join requests remain separate child
// capabilities and are exported here for the organization feature boundary.
