/// Realm application state and boundary adapters for the organization panel.
///
/// This library connects route selected realms to their authoritative catalogs,
/// authoring projections, editor resources, capability invocation, and
/// presentation search. Riverpod providers construct the graph only when an
/// organization and an online realm exist. NATS adapters translate between
/// those application contracts and the realm service wire protocols.
///
/// Canonical authoring data belongs to [AuthoringSession]. Catalog snapshots
/// belong to [RealmEditorCatalogCache]. Editor drafts remain owned by the
/// shared editor and mutation layers. The realm service remains authoritative
/// for durable content and catalog generation.
