/// [query] is the source of truth owned by the caller. Every edit, including a
/// completion, is reported through [onQueryChanged]; callers must feed the
/// accepted value back into [query]. [selectors] define the query language and
/// drive both highlighting and suggestions. While the popup is visible,
/// keyboard navigation changes its active suggestion without moving focus out
/// of the editor. Submission accepts the active suggestion first, then calls
/// [onSubmitted] with the resulting query when no suggestion handled it.
