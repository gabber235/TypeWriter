/*
 * Editing is deliberately owned separately from persistence.
 *
 * The owner exposes the current local value and preserves its invariants while
 * presentation code edits it. A transactional implementation may also own a
 * canonical resource snapshot, a local draft, revision tracking, persistence
 * attempts, and reconciliation, but those states remain distinct. Callers must
 * use the operations here instead of mutating a value or coordinating saves
 * themselves. Implementations notify listeners after an observable state
 * change and release all owned interaction state from dispose.
