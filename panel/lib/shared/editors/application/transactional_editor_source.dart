/*
 * Coordinates one editable resource without collapsing local and remote state.
 *
 * TransactionalEditorSource owns the lifecycle of a canonical EditorDocument,
 * a separate local draft, local revisions, pending structural mutations,
 * persistence attempts, and reconciliation decisions. The document is the
 * last accepted resource state. The draft is what the editor currently shows
 * and may contain edits that have never been sent. Revisions order canonical
 * observations; they do not identify local edits. Persistence captures an
 * immutable commit, and reconciliation decides how a later remote observation
 * affects the draft. Typed mutation results expose success, conflict, invalid,
 * denied, uncertain, and unavailable outcomes so callers do not infer
 * durability from a completed future.
 *
 * Only this source mutates the combined editing state. Consumers observe it,
 * submit explicit operations, and resolve reported conflicts. A source is
 * single threaded at the Dart event loop boundary: a commit may be awaiting
 * external work, but remote updates and later edits are serialized when they
 * reenter the source. dispose invalidates outstanding work and prevents a
 * stale completion from changing state.
